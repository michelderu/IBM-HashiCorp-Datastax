## Prerequisites

1. **Terraform**: Install Terraform version 1.0 or later
2. **Astra Account**: You need a DataStax Astra account
3. **API Token**: Generate an API token from your Astra account

## Setup

This Terraform configuration sets up a DataStax Astra database with 1 PCU (Processing Capacity Unit).

1. **Clone or download this configuration**

2. **Configure your variables**:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   ```
   Edit `terraform.tfvars` and set your values, especially:
   - `user_email`: Your email address
   - `database_name`: Name for your database
   - `keyspace_name`: Name for your keyspace
   - `cloud_provider`: AWS, GCP, or AZURE
   - `region`: Your preferred region

3. **Set up your API token** (choose one method):
   - Set the `ASTRA_API_TOKEN` environment variable:
     ```bash
     export ASTRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"
     ```
   - Or add your token to the `terraform.tfvars` file:
     ```hcl
     astra_token = "your-api-token-here"
     ```

## Usage

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Plan the deployment**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply the configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **View outputs**:
   ```bash
   terraform output
   ```

## Configuration Details

### Database Configuration
- **Capacity Units**: 1 PCU (fixed)
- **Serverless Scaling**: Min/Max set to 1 PCU
- **Continuous Backup**: Configurable (default: disabled)
- **Streaming**: Configurable (default: disabled)

### Supported Cloud Providers
- AWS
- GCP
- Azure

### Available Regions
The available regions depend on your chosen cloud provider. Common regions include:
- **AWS**: us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, etc.
- **GCP**: us-central1, europe-west1, etc.
- **Azure**: eastus, westus2, etc.

## Outputs

After successful deployment, Terraform will output:
- `database_id`: Unique identifier for your database
- `database_name`: Name of the created database
- `database_status`: Current status of the database
- `database_region`: Region where the database is deployed
- `database_keyspace`: Name of the keyspace
- `database_cloud_provider`: Cloud provider used
- `database_capacity_units`: Number of capacity units (1)
- `database_org_id`: Organization ID
- `database_secure_bundle_url`: URL to download the secure bundle for connections
- `token`: Database token (if created)

## Cleanup

To destroy the resources:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication Issues**: Ensure your API token is valid and has the necessary permissions
2. **Region Issues**: Verify the region is available for your chosen cloud provider
3. **Resource Limits**: Check if you have available capacity in your Astra organization
